# VBA-challenge

The description of used Syntaxes in included in the code found in .bas file.

**Briefly:**

- I declared the values as Double (moslty), expcet for Ticker names which I declared as String.

- Created new columns and found their values (Ticker, Yearly Change, Percentage Chage, Total Volume)

- I found the number of used Rows across these worksheets and used that to generate Tickers and then found missing values

- I used conditional fomrmatting to change the colours of Yearly Change to red if <0, or green if >0 (white if =0)


**I included the following files:**

1. VBA_Jsacharz.bas which includes my code and descriptions to respective syntaxes
2. VBA_2018 screenprint of excel worksheet for 2018 after running my code
3. VBA_2019 screenprint of excel worksheet for 2018 after running my code
4. VBA_2020 screenprint of excel worksheet for 2018 after running my code

_Note: _The final values in the worksheet are different than what is shown in the homework instructions, I have been sitting on it for a very long time and couldn't figure out where I made a miastke.
